# Computer Organization and Assembly Language Code.

I learnt Computer Organization & assembly language from Dr Muhammad Nauman (recluze youtube channel)

He used popular Assemblt Book by Belal Hashmi.
I did several exercises from the book and also coded along the videos of Dr Nauman. 

I want to grind Computer Architecture and Reverse Engineering with the help of this knowledge
